TFTP Server Script


This script enables a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server on your local machine, listening on port 71.

Usage

Once the script is executed, the TFTP server will start running on your local machine, listening on port 71. You can now transfer files to and from the server using a TFTP client.
